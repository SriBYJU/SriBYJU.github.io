  <h2>About This Project</h2>
  <p>
    I chose to focus on advanced dinking and at-the-line offensive techniques because pickleball is personal to me.
    My dream is to go professional, and I am currently on that path.
  </p>
  <p>
    This website is designed to help other players reach their goals while also strengthening my own understanding
    of high-level pickleball. By sharing techniques I’ve learned and developed, I hope to make the journey smoother
    for other competitive and aspiring professional players.

<section id="techniques">
  <h2>Advanced Dinking Techniques</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Soft Hands Control:</strong> Using a relaxed grip to maintain consistency and touch.</li>
    <li><strong>Paddle Angle Awareness:</strong> Adjusting face angle to keep dinks low and unattackable.</li>
    <li><strong>Push Dinks:</strong> Applying light pressure to move opponents out of position.</li>
    <li><strong>Attack Setups:</strong> Disguising offensive intentions during dink exchanges.</li>
    <li><strong>Resets at the Kitchen:</strong> Recovering from tough positions with controlled drops.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section id="videos">
  <h2>Instructional Videos</h2>

  <h2>Project Success Criteria</h2>
  <p>
    This project will be successful if the website clearly teaches advanced dinking and
    at-the-line offensive techniques through written explanations and videos.
  </p>
  <p>
    It will also be successful if players say the lessons helped improve their dinking,
    decision-making, and overall gameplay.
  </p>
  <p>
    Finally, success means I become more confident in my own advanced dinking skills
    and can apply them effectively in real matches.
