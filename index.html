  <h2>Reflection on Personal Project</h2>
  <p>
    Completing this project taught me to analyze advanced techniques, organize instructional content, and share knowledge effectively. I learned to be reflective by evaluating my own dinking skills and improving over time, and balanced by managing practice, research, and teaching. This experience showed me the value of persistence and thoughtful strategy, traits I will carry into future projects and competitions.
