  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    My name is <strong>Shriyan Avadhanula</strong>. Some of you may be wondering why you should trust just some random teenager about this?
    Although I am just a teenager, I've conducted extensive research and spent over 1,000 hours playing this sport, which I'm highly dedicated to and passionate about.
    I am a <strong>high-level pickleball player sponsored by
    some of the most well-known companies in the sport</strong>, including Paddletek, Franklin Sports, Head Racket Sports,
    and Acacia Sports. I created this website to help me learn advanced dinking techniques, progress in my journey
    toward becoming a professional player, and share this knowledge to help others improve their skills.
  </p>
</section>

<section id="techniques">
  <h2>Advanced Dinking Techniques Overview</h2>
  <p>
    Dinking is one of the most important skills in high-level pickleball. Mastering both offensive and defensive
    dinking strategies allows a player to control the kitchen line, maintain rallies, and set up scoring opportunities.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Soft Hands & Paddle Angle: Maintain control while keeping the ball low and unattackable.</li>
    <li>Disguising Shots: Hide your offensive intent until the last moment.</li>
    <li>Resetting: Recover from tough positions to stay aggressive at the net.</li>
    <li>Footwork & Positioning: Stay balanced and prepared for all returns.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section id="defensive">
  <h2>Defensive Dinking</h2>
  <p>
    Defensive dinking focuses on keeping the ball in play while waiting for the opponent to make a mistake.
    It requires patience, precision, and consistency. Top players emphasize that good defensive dinking allows
    you to reset the point and maintain control at the kitchen line.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Use a loose grip to absorb speed and control ball height.</li>
    <li>Angle the paddle slightly upward to keep the ball low over the net.</li>
    <li>Maintain proper distance from the net and anticipate opponent movement (USA Pickleball Coaching Committee, 2023).</li>
    <li>Mix in cross-court and straight dinks to force movement.</li>
  </ul>
  <div class="tip">
    <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Watch professional doubles matches on the PPA Tour to see how players defend with soft dinks while forcing errors.
  </div>
</section>

<section id="offensive">
  <h2>Offensive Dinking</h2>
  <p>
    Offensive dinking is about creating scoring opportunities. It uses deception, speed changes, and placement to
    put pressure on opponents. Advanced players like those on the PPA Tour combine offensive dinking with strategic
    movement to set up put-away shots.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Push dinks to the opponent’s feet to limit their options.</li>
    <li>Use sudden directional changes to force weak returns (Pickleball360 Analysis, 2024).</li>
    <li>Disguise your intentions until the last moment to create openings.</li>
    <li>Combine offensive dinks with aggressive positioning at the net.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section id="spin-footwork">
  <h2>Spin & Footwork</h2>
  <p>
    Spin and footwork are key to controlling dinking exchanges. Proper spin allows you to manipulate the ball
    trajectory, while good footwork ensures you can recover and stay ready.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Topspin:</strong> Makes the ball drop faster, useful for offensive dinks.</li>
    <li><strong>Backspin:</strong> Slows the ball down, keeps it low, and gives defensive control.</li>
    <li><strong>Side Spin:</strong> Can create angles and push opponents out of position.</li>
    <li><strong>Footwork:</strong> Stay on your toes, move with small, quick steps, and always anticipate the next ball.</li>
  </ul>
  <div class="tip">
    <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Top players like Tyson McGuffin and Catherine Parenteau use footwork to maintain balance and apply precise spin consistently.
